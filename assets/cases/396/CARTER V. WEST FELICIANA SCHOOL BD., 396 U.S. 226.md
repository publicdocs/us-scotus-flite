THIS MATTER REACHES THE COURT ON AN APPLICATION PRESENTED TO MR. JUSTICE BLACK, AS CIRCUIT JUSTICE FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, SEEKING A TEMPORARY INJUNCTIVE ORDER AND OTHER RELIEF; AND IT APPEARING THAT

THESE PLANS WERE REJECTED BY THE DISTRICT COURTS.

3.  THE DISTRICT COURTS' ORDERS WERE REVERSED BY THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT SITTING EN BANC, ON DECEMBER 1, 1969, SUBSEQUENT TO THIS COURT'S DECISION IN ALEXANDER V. HOLMES COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION, ANTE, AT 19.

IF PETITIONERS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLERICAL TASKS NECESSARY TO CONVERSION WILL HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN ROUGHLY ACCORDING TO THE TIMETABLE ESTABLISHED BY THE COURT BELOW IN THE ALEXANDER CASES, AND PETITIONERS' RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE RELIEF WILL NOT HAVE BEEN PUT IN QUESTION BY THE PASSAGE OF TIME.  IF PETITIONERS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN THIS COURT, THE SCHOOL BOARDS WOULD BE UNDER NO COMPULSION TO CONVERT DURING THIS SCHOOL YEAR."  APPLICATION TO THE HONORABLE HUGO L. BLACK, CIRCUIT JUSTICE FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, FOR A TEMPORARY INJUNCTIVE ORDER 3-4.
