CRANE-JOHNSON CO. V. HELVERING, 311 U.S. 54

NO. 8.  ARGUED OCTOBER 23, 1940.  - DECIDED NOVEMBER 12, 1940.  - 105 F.2D 740, AFFIRMED.

DECIDED ON THE AUTHORITY OF HELVERING V. NORTHWEST STEEL ROLLING MILLS, ANTE, P. 46.

CRANE-JOHNSON COMPANY V. HELVERING, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

CERTIORARI, 309 U.S. 692, TO REVIEW THE AFFIRMANCE OF A DECISION OF THE BOARD OF TAX APPEALS, 38 B.T.A. 1355, WHICH SUSTAINED THE COMMISSIONER'S DETERMINATION OF A TAX DEFICIENCY.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

BECAUSE OF A PREVIOUSLY EXISTING DEFICIT, PETITIONER CORPORATION WAS PROHIBITED BY STATE LAW FN1  FROM DISTRIBUTING AS DIVIDENDS ITS PROFITS EARNED IN 1936.  NOTWITHSTANDING THIS STATE PROHIBITION, THE COMMISSIONER HELD RESPONDENT LIABLE UNDER THE 1936 REVENUE ACT  FN2 FOR SURTAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED PROFITS.  THE BOARD OF TAX APPEALS SUSTAINED THE COMMISSIONER,  FN3  AND THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED.  FN4  ON A SIMILAR STATE OF FACTS THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT HELD UNDISTRIBUTED PROFITS EXEMPT FROM SURTAX.  FN5 WE GRANTED CERTIORARI IN BOTH CASES TO RESOLVE THIS CONFLICT.  FN6  THE LEGAL QUESTIONS HERE PRESENTED ARE IN ALL RESPECTS THE SAME AS THOSE PRESENTED IN HELVERING V. NORTHWEST STEEL ROLLING MILLS, ANTE, P. 46, AND ON THE AUTHORITY OF THAT CASE THE DECISION BELOW IS AFFIRMED.

FN1  "THE DIRECTORS OF CORPORATIONS MUST NOT MAKE DIVIDENDS EXCEPT FROM THE SURPLUS PROFITS ARISING FROM THE BUSINESS THEREOF  ..."  N.D. COMP. LAWS (SUPP. 1925) SEC. 4543.

FN2  49 STAT. 1648, 1655.

FN3  38 B.T.A. 1355.

FN4  105 F.2D 740.

FN5  NORTHWEST STEEL ROLLING MILLS V. COMMISSIONER, 110 F.2D 286.

FN6  309 U.S. 692; POST, P. 629.
