MEEKS V. GEORGIA SOUTHERN & FLORIDA RAILWAY CO.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF GEORGIA.

PER CURIAM.

THE PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF CERTIORARI ARE GRANTED AND THE JUDGMENTS ARE REVERSED.  ROGERS V. MISSOURI PACIFIC R. CO., 352 U.S. 500.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, WHOM MR. JUSTICE STEWART JOINS, DISSENTING IN NO. 981, AND DISSENTING IN PART AND CONCURRING IN PART IN NO. 1004.

FEELING OBLIGED, HOWEVER, TO REACH THE MERITS BECAUSE THE CASES ARE BEFORE US, SEE MY OPINION IN ROGERS V. MISSOURI P.R. CO., 352 U.S. 500, 559-562, I DISSENT FROM THE JUDGMENT IN NO. 981 AND CONCUR IN THE JUDGMENT IN NO. 1004.
