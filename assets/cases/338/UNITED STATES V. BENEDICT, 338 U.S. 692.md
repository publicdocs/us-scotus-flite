    UNITED STATES V. BENEDICT, [338 U.S. 692][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/338/692]

    NO. 45.  ARGUED NOVEMBER 8, 1949.  - DECIDED FEBRUARY 13, 1950.  - 112 CT. CL. 550, 81 F.SUPP.  717, REVERSED.

    IN 1944, TRUSTEES PERMANENTLY SET ASIDE A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAINS REALIZED UPON THE DISPOSITION OF CAPITAL ASSETS HELD IN THE TRUST FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS.  PURSUANT TO SEC. 117(B) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, THEY TREATED ONLY 50% OF THESE CAPITAL GAINS AS INCOME IN COMPUTING THE INCOME OF THE TRUST.  HELD:  UNDER SEC. 162(A), ONLY 50% OF THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION (THE PROPORTIONATE PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TAXABLE PART OF THE CAPITAL GAINS) COULD BE DEDUCTED IN COMPUTING THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX OF THE TRUST.  PP. 692-699.

    UNITED STATES V. BENEDICT ET AL., TRUSTEES, ET AL.

    CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

    THE COURT OF CLAIMS AWARDED RESPONDENTS A JUDGMENT FOR A REFUND OF INCOME TAXES.  112 CT. CL. 550, 81 F.SUPP.  717.  THIS COURT GRANTED CERTIORARI.  [336 U.S. 966][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/336/966].  REVERSED, P. 699.

    MR. JUSTICE BURTON DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

    THE QUESTION PRESENTED IS WHETHER TRUSTEES, WHO, IN 1944, PERMANENTLY SET ASIDE A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION FROM GAINS REALIZED UPON THE DISPOSITION OF CAPITAL ASSETS HELD FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS, WERE ENTITLED, IN COMPUTING THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX OF THE TRUST, TO DEDUCT THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CONTRIBUTION,  FN1  ALTHOUGH ONLY HALF OF THOSE GAINS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN COMPUTING NET INCOME.  FN2  FOR THE REASONS HEREAFTER STATED, OUR ANSWER IS IN THE NEGATIVE.

    THE RESPONDENTS ARE TRUSTEES OF A TRUST CREATED BY THE WILL OF JOHN E. ANDRUS.  THE WILL DIRECTS THAT THE NET INCOME OF THE TRUST BE DIVIDED INTO 100 PARTS, 55 TO BE PAID TO CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL BENEFICIARIES AND 45 TO THE SURDNA FOUNDATION, INC., A CHARITABLE CORPORATION.  FN3  PURSUANT TO THOSE TERMS THE TRUSTEES PERMANENTLY SET ASIDE FOR THE FOUNDATION 45% OF THE TRUST'S NET INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 1944, THE PERIOD INVOLVED IN THIS CASE.

    IN THEIR FIDUCIARY TAX RETURN, THE TRUSTEES REPORTED ORDINARY NET INCOME OF $240,567.73, AND DEDUCTED FROM IT, AS A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION, THE $108,255.48(45% OF THAT NET INCOME) WHICH THEY HAD SET ASIDE FOR THE SURDNA FOUNDATION.  THIS WAS DONE UNDER SEC. 162(A) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.  FN4  THE TRUSTEES ALSO REPORTED GAINS OF $60,374.01 ON THE DISPOSITION OF CAPITAL ASSETS HELD FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS.  OF THESE GAINS, THEY TOOK INTO ACCOUNT ONLY 50%, AMOUNTING TO $30,187.01, IN COMPUTING THE TRUST'S TAXABLE INCOME.  THIS WAS DONE UNDER SEC. 117(B).  FN5  AN UNCONTROVERTED DEDUCTION OF $329.60, REPRESENTING THE CARRY-OVER OF A 1942 LOSS, REDUCED THIS AMOUNT TO $29,857.41.  FROM THIS THE TRUSTEES DEDUCTED 45%, REPRESENTING A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE TRUST'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE SURDNA FOUNDATION.  THIS DEDUCTION AMOUNTED TO $13,435.83, LEAVING A TAXABLE NET INCOME OF $16,421.58, ON WHICH A TAX OF $5,480.35 WAS PAID, PLUS INTEREST.

    IN 1947 THE TRUSTEES FILED A CLAIM FOR A REFUND OF $5,157.41.  THEY BASED THEIR CLAIM UPON A 1946 DECISION OF THE TAX COURT AS TO THE 1941 TAXES OF A NEARLY IDENTICAL TRUST.  ANDRUS TRUST NO. 1 V. COMMISSIONER, 7 T.C. 573.  ON THAT BASIS, THE TRUSTEES CLAIMED A DEDUCTION FROM THE AFORESAID $29,857.41, NOT ONLY OF A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE CONTRIBUTION WHICH THE TRUST HAD SET ASIDE FROM CAPITAL GAINS, BUT OF THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THAT CONTRIBUTION.  THIS INCREASED THAT DEDUCTION FROM $13,435.83(45% OF $29,857.41) TO $27,168.31(45% OF THE TOTAL CAPITAL GAINS OF $60,374.01), AND CORRESPONDINGLY REDUCED THE TRUST'S TAXABLE NET INCOME FROM $16,421.58 TO $2,689.10.

    IN JULY, 1947, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT UNANIMOUSLY REVERSED THE TAX COURT IN THE CASE RELATING TO 1941 TAXES.

    COMMISSIONER V. CENTRAL HANOVER BANK CO., 163 F.2D 208, CERT. DENIED, NOVEMBER, 1947, [332 U.S. 830][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/332/830].  THE COMMISSIONER, HOWEVER, TOOK NO ACTION ON THE TRUSTEES' CLAIM FOR A REFUND RELATING TO 1944 TAXES, AND, IN 1948, THE TRUSTEES FILED THIS PROCEEDING FOR ITS RECOVERY THROUGH THE COURT OF CLAIMS.  WITH ONE JUDGE DISSENTING, THAT COURT DECIDED IN THEIR FAVOR.  112 CT. CL. 550, 81 F.SUPP.  717.  TO RESOLVE THE RESULTING CONFLICT, WE GRANTED CERTIORARI.  [336 U.S. 966][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/336/966].

    AN ILLUSTRATION BASED UPON THE FACTS IN THE INSTANT CASE WILL BRING THE STATUTORY PROBLEM INTO CLEARER FOCUS.  A TRUST REALIZES GAINS OF $60,000 DURING THE TAX YEAR FROM THE SALE OF CAPITAL ASSETS HELD FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS.  FROM THESE IT MAKES A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION OF 50%. SECTION 162(A) OF THE CODE  FN6  PROVIDES THAT A TRUST MAY DEDUCT ANY PART OF ITS "GROSS INCOME" WHICH IT CONTRIBUTES TO SUCH A CHARITY AS THE ONE SELECTED.  SECTION 117(B)  FN7  PROVIDES THAT ONLY 50% OF SUCH GAINS SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN COMPUTING NET INCOME.

    THE TRUSTEES CONTEND THAT, FOR TAX PURPOSES, THE ENTIRE $60,000 IS "GROSS INCOME," THAT FROM THIS AMOUNT THE $30,000 CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION MAY BE DEDUCTED UNDER SEC. 162(A), AND THAT THE ENTIRE REMAINING $30,000 IS TO BE LEFT OUT OF ACCOUNT BY FORCE OF SEC. 117(B), THEREBY LEAVING NO TAXABLE NET INCOME, ALTHOUGH $30,000 GOES TO INDIVIDUAL BENEFICIARIES.  THE COMMISSIONER, HOWEVER, CONTENDS THAT ONLY THE $30,000 OF THE RECOGNIZED CAPITAL GAINS THAT IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY FORCE OF SEC. 117(B) CONSTITUTES "GROSS INCOME," AND THAT NECESSARILY THE OTHER $30,000 THAT IS NOT TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR TAX PURPOSES IS NOT "GROSS INCOME."  BEGINNING, THUS, WITH $30,000 OF GROSS INCOME, THE COMMISSIONER ALLOWS A DEDUCTION FROM IT OF THAT PROPORTIONATE PART OF THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HALF OF THE RECOGNIZED CAPITAL GAINS WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  THAT DEDUCTION AMOUNTS TO $15,000, LEAVING A TAXABLE NET INCOME OF $15,000.

    THE NARROW STATUTORY QUESTION THUS PRESENTED IS WHETHER THE ENTIRE RECOGNIZED CAPITAL GAINS OR ONLY THAT HALF TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT UNDER SEC. 117(B) SHALL CONSTITUTE GROSS INCOME FOR TAX PURPOSES.  STATED CONVERSELY, THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT HALF OF A TAXPAYER'S RECOGNIZED CAPITAL GAINS THAT IS NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR TAX PURPOSES SHALL BE LEFT OUT OF ACCOUNT BY WAY OF ITS INITIAL EXCLUSION FROM GROSS INCOME, OR BY WAY OF ITS SUBSEQUENT DEDUCTION FROM GROSS INCOME.  ON THIS PRECISE QUESTION THE CODE IS SILENT.  NO PROVISION OF THE CODE AND NOTHING IN THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OR ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE EXPRESSLY SETTLES THE COURSE TO BE FOLLOWED.  WE, THEREFORE, SEEK THE PURPOSES OF THE APPLICABLE SECTIONS OF THE CODE AND ADOPT THAT CONSTRUCTION WHICH BEST GIVES EFFECT TO THOSE PURPOSES.

    WE FIND THAT THE OBVIOUS PURPOSE OF SEC. 162(A) IS TO ENCOURAGE THE MAKING OF CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OUT OF THE GROSS INCOME OF A TRUST AND, TO THAT END, IT COMPLETELY EXEMPTS SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INCOME TAX, WITHOUT THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED UPON CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY INDIVIDUALS OR CORPORATIONS.  FN8 THIS PURPOSE IS SERVED BY EACH OF THE CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE CODE SUGGESTED BY THE PARTIES.  UNDER EITHER METHOD OF COMPUTATION THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION WILL RECEIVE IT IN FULL AND FREE OF TAX.

    WE THEN FIND THAT THE EFFECT OF SEC. 117(B) IS TO TAX RECOGNIZED CAPITAL GAINS LIKE ORDINARY INCOME, EXCEPT THAT THE TAX ON CAPITAL GAINS HELD FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS IS TO BE COMPUTED ON 50% OF THE AMOUNT ON WHICH IT WOULD BE COMPUTED IF THOSE GAINS WERE ORDINARY INCOME.  THE COMMISSIONER'S SOLUTION ACCOMPLISHES PRECISELY THAT RESULT AND THUS SERVES THAT PURPOSE.  IN THE ILLUSTRATION, IF THE GAINS WERE ORDINARY INCOME, THE AMOUNT SUBJECT TO TAX, AFTER THE DEDUCTION OF THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION, WOULD BE $30,000.  AS IT IS, THE AMOUNT SUBJECT TO TAX IS $15,000.  THE TRUSTEES' CONSTRUCTION IN THE INSTANT CASE WOULD RESULT IN TAXING THE CAPITAL GAINS AT SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN 50% OF THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THEY WOULD BE TAXED IF THEY WERE ORDINARY INCOME.  TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AMOUNT SUBJECT TO TAX GOES BELOW THAT PERCENTAGE, IT FAILS TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE PURPOSE OF SEC. 117(B).  FN9  IN THE MORE EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGESTED BY THE ILLUSTRATION, THIS CONSTRUCTION WOULD ENTIRELY ELIMINATE THE TAX.

    WE, THEREFORE, APPROVE THAT INTERPRETATION OF SEC. 117(B) AND THE DEFINITION OF STATUTORY GROSS INCOME ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSIONER.  WE TREAT THE WORDS IN SEC. 117(B), WHICH STATE THAT ONLY 50% OF CERTAIN RECOGNIZED CAPITAL GAINS "SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN COMPUTING  ... NET INCOME," AS APPLYING TO THE ENTIRE COMPUTATION OF THE TAX, BEGINNING WITH THE STATEMENT OF THE GROSS INCOME OF THE TRUST AND CONCLUDING WITH ITS TAXABLE NET INCOME.  FN10  WE TREAT THAT PERCENTAGE OF CAPITAL GAINS WHICH EXPRESSLY IS NOT TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN COMPUTING TAXABLE NET INCOME AS ALSO EXCLUDED FROM STATUTORY GROSS INCOME.  FN11

    ACCORDINGLY, THE ACCEPTANCE BY THE COMMISSIONER OF THE ORIGINAL RETURN IS APPROVED AND THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF CLAIMS IS REVERSED.

    FN1  "SEC.  162.  NET INCOME.

    "THE NET INCOME OF THE ESTATE OR TRUST SHALL BE COMPUTED IN THE SAME MANNER AND ON THE SAME BASIS AS IN THE CASE OF AN INDIVIDUAL, EXCEPT THAT -

    "(B)  PERCENTAGE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  - IN THE CASE OF A TAXPAYER, OTHER THAN A CORPORATION, ONLY THE FOLLOWING PERCENTAGES OF THE GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED UPON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF A CAPITAL ASSET SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN COMPUTING NET CAPITAL GAIN, NET CAPITAL LOSS, AND NET INCOME:

    FN3  THE WILL CREATING THE TRUST CONTAINED NO PROVISION AS TO THE KIND OF INCOME FROM WHICH THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE TO BE SET ASIDE, AND IT IS NOT DISPUTED THAT THE TRUSTEES PROPERLY SET ASIDE THE CONTRIBUTIONS PROPORTIONATELY FROM CAPITAL GAINS AND ALL OTHER INCOME.

    THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT THE TRUSTEES, IN SETTING ASIDE THE CONTRIBUTION, ATTEMPTED TO ALLOCATE THEM TO ANY PARTICULAR PART OR PERCENTAGE OF THE CAPITAL GAINS.  SEE HELVERING V.

    FN10  IT IS UNNECESSARY TO REVIEW THE INTRICATE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED AS TO THE TERMINOLOGY OF THE CODE.  THEY DO NOT COMPEL THE ADOPTION OF EITHER INTERPRETATION OR PRECLUDE THE CONCLUSION HERE REACHED.  THIS IS NOT A CASE IN WHICH THE TRUST OR THE STATUTE HAS REQUIRED OR EVEN AUTHORIZED THE TRUSTEES TO EARMARK THEIR CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AS COMING FROM ANY PARTICULAR ITEMS OF TRUST INCOME, OR FROM ANY PARTICULAR KIND OF TRUST INCOME.  THE ISSUE DOES NOT INVOLVE ANY POSSIBLE ALLOCATION OF A CHARITABLE DEDUCTION TO ORDINARY INCOME RATHER THAN TO CAPITAL GAINS.

    FOR THE REQUIREMENT THAT, UNDER SEC. 162(A), EACH CONTRIBUTION IN ORDER TO BE DEDUCTIBLE MUST BE MADE OR PERMANENTLY SET ASIDE PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE WILL OR DEED CREATING THE TRUST, AND ALSO MUST BE FROM A PART OF THE GROSS INCOME OF THE TRUST, SEE OLD COLONY TRUST CO.

    MR. JUSTICE BLACK AND MR. JUSTICE JACKSON ARE OF THE OPINION THAT THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF CLAIMS SHOULD BE AFFIRMED FOR THE REASONS WHICH IT GAVE.

    MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS TOOK NO PART IN THE CONSIDERATION OR DECISION OF THIS CASE.

    MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTHER.    THE CONTRARIETY OF VIEWS EXPRESSED BY THE TAX COURT, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT, THE COURT OF CLAIMS AND NOW BY THIS COURT IN THE TASK OF HARMONIZING SECS. 22(A), 117(B) AND 162(A) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE CONCLUSIVELY PROVES THE OPAQUENESS, IF NOT INHERENT INCONGRUITY, OF THOSE PROVISIONS.  COURTS MUST DO THE BEST THEY CAN WITH SUCH MATERIALS SINCE THE POWER TO WRITE OR REWRITE LEGISLATION IS NOT THEIRS.  BUT THE FACT THAT A TAXPAYER MAY ASTUTELY APPLY HIS INCOME SO AS TO REDUCE THE NET BASE ON WHICH A TAX IS TO BE LEVIED IS NOT IN ITSELF GROUND FOR REJECTING A CONSTRUCTION OF THE REVENUE CODE WHICH PERMITS THE REDUCED BASE, EVEN THOUGH THE PARTICULAR MODE OF DISTRIBUTING HIS INCOME MAY NOT HAVE BEEN CONTEMPLATED IN THE ENACTMENT OF THE CLASSES OF EXEMPTIONS AND DEDUCTIONS WITHIN WHICH THE TAXPAYER BRINGS HIMSELF.  I, TOO, RECOIL FROM A BIZARRE RESULT AND IF LEGISLATION IS AMBIGUOUS ITS CONSTRUCTION SHOULD AVOID SUCH A RESULT.  BUT THE RATIONALE OF CONSTRUCTION STRUCTION OUGHT NOT TO BE BASED ON THE IMPACT OF A SINGLE BIZARRE INSTANCE.

    A DEDUCTION FOR TRUST INCOME APPLIED TO CHARITABLE PURPOSES SHOULD NOT BE DISALLOWED MERELY BECAUSE ONE TAXPAYER CAN EFFECT THE PAYMENT OF A LOWER INCOME TAX THAN ANOTHER THROUGH THE MODE BY WHICH THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION IS MADE.  THUS, WHERE THE TRUST INSTRUMENT PROVIDES THAT ALL CHARITABLE DONATIONS SHALL BE ALLOCATED FROM ORDINARY INCOME AND NOT FROM CAPITAL GAINS, THE TAXPAYER MAY DOUBTLESS DEDUCT SUCH CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS IN FULL AND MAY AT THE SAME TIME REPORT ANY CAPITAL GAINS UNDER THE SPECIAL CAPITAL GAINS PROVISIONS OF THE CODE.  THIS WOULD SECURE THE VERY BENEFITS SOUGHT BY THE TAXPAYERS HERE.  THE RULE ENUNCIATED BY THE COURT MAY THEREFORE ITSELF REST TAX LIABILITY ON THE ASTUTENESS SHOWN IN DRAWING THE TRUST INSTRUMENT ALLOCATING INCOME FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES.

    SINCE I AM NOT ALONE IN ENTERTAINING THESE DOUBTS AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN DISPELLED, IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO EXPRESS THEM.

    NO. 70.  ARGUED NOVEMBER 17-18, 1949.  - DECIDED FEBRUARY 6, 1950.  - 172 F.2D 77, REVERSED.

    RESPONDENT CORPORATION FILED A FEDERAL TAX RETURN FOR 1941 AND TIMELY PAID THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX SHOWN THEREON.  IN 1943, AFTER RESPONDENT HAD BEEN ADJUDGED A BANKRUPT, THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, USING THE ACCELERATED PROCEDURE APPLICABLE IN BANKRUPTCY CASES, ASSESSED A DEFICIENCY IN THE 1941 TAX WITH INTEREST FROM THE DATE THE TAX WAS PROPERLY DUE TO THE ASSESSMENT DATE.  RESPONDENT SUBSEQUENTLY FILED ITS RETURN FOR 1943, WHICH DISCLOSED A NET OPERATING LOSS FOR THAT YEAR.  UNDER THE CARRY-BACK PROVISION OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, THIS LOSS WAS SUFFICIENT TO ABATE COMPLETELY RESPONDENT'S TAX LIABILITY FOR 1941.  HELD:  RESPONDENT WAS NOT ENTITLED TO A REFUND OF THE INTEREST WHICH HAD BEEN ASSESSED ON THE TAX DEFICIENCY.  PP. 562 571.

    (A)  THE SUBSEQUENT CANCELLATION OF THE ASSESSED DEFICIENCY BY OPERATION OF THE CARRY-BACK PROVISION DID NOT CANCEL RESPONDENT'S OBLIGATION TO PAY THE INTEREST ASSESSED ON THE DEFICIENCY.  PP. 565 566.

    (B)  ENACTMENT OF THE CARRY-BACK PROVISION IN 1942 DID NOT CHANGE THE BASIC STATUTORY POLICY THAT THE UNITED STATES IS TO HAVE THE POSSESSION AND USE OF THE LAWFUL TAX AT THE DATE IT IS PROPERLY DUE.  PP. 566 567.

    (C)  THE CONCLUSION THAT THE CARRY-BACK PROVISION DOES NOT RETROACTIVELY ALTER THE DUTY OF THE TAXPAYER TO PAY HIS FULL TAX PROMPTLY IS SUPPORTED BY SEC. 3771(E) OF THE CODE, WHICH PROHIBITS A TAXPAYER WHO DOES PAY A TAX WHICH IS SUBSEQUENTLY ABATED BY A CARRY BACK FROM CLAIMING INTEREST FROM THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE INTERVENING PERIOD.  PP. 567-568.

    (D)  WHERE A DEFICIENCY AND INTEREST HAVE BEEN VALIDLY ASSESSED UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATUTORY PROCEDURE, A SUBSEQUENT CARRY-BACK WITH AN ABATEMENT OF THE DEFICIENCY DOES NOT ABATE THE INTEREST PREVIOUSLY ASSESSED ON THAT DEFICIENCY.  PP. 569-570.

    IN AN ACTION AGAINST THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE TO RECOVER AN AMOUNT WITHHELD AS INTEREST ON A TAX DEFICIENCY WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ABATED, THE DISTRICT COURT GAVE JUDGMENT FOR THE COLLECTOR.  76 F.SUPP.  937.  THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED.  172 F.2D 77.  THIS COURT GRANTED CERTIORARI.  [337 U.S. 955][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/337/955].  REVERSED, P. 571.

    MR. CHIEF JUSTICE VINSON DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

    THE FACTS OF THIS CASE HAVE BEEN AGREED UPON BY STIPULATION.  ON DECEMBER 15, 1941, RESPONDENT TAXPAYER, A NEW JERSEY CORPORATION, FILED A CORPORATE TAX RETURN FOR ITS FISCAL PERIOD, JANUARY 1, 1941, TO SEPTEMBER 30, 1941.  ON JANUARY 12, 1942, THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE ASSESSED THE TAX,  FN1  WHICH RESPONDENT TIMELY PAID.

    RESPONDENT WAS ADJUDGED A BANKRUPT AND A RECEIVER WAS APPOINTED ON JULY 7, 1943.  ON AUGUST 2, 1943, THE COMMISSIONER, USING THE ACCELERATED PROCEDURE APPLICABLE IN BANKRUPTCY CASES,  FN2  ASSESSED DEFICIENCIES IN THE 1941 TAXES WITH INTEREST FROM THE DATE THE TAX WAS PROPERLY DUE TO THE ASSESSMENT DATE.  FN3

    ON MARCH 3, 1944, RESPONDENT FILED ITS RETURN FOR THE FISCAL PERIOD FROM OCTOBER 1, 1942, TO SEPTEMBER 30, 1943, SHOWING A NET OPERATING LOSS  FN4  FOR THAT YEAR.  THIS LOSS, WHEN CARRIED BACK IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC. 122(B)(1) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE,  FN5  WAS SUFFICIENT TO ABATE COMPLETELY RESPONDENT'S TAX LIABILITY FOR 1941.  RESPONDENT THEN FILED CLAIMS FOR A REFUND OF THAT PART OF THE 1941 TAX WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PAID, AND FOR THE ABATEMENT OF THE ASSESSED DEFICIENCY AND INTEREST.  THE COMMISSIONER ABATED THE DEFICIENCY, BUT REFUSED TO REFUND ALL THE TAX WHICH HAD BEEN PAID, RETAINING AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE INTEREST WHICH HAD BEEN ASSESSED ON THE DEFICIENCY.

    RESPONDENT THEN SUED THE COLLECTOR FOR THE INTEREST.  THE DISTRICT COURT SUSTAINED THE COLLECTER, HOLDING THAT THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST REMAINED AN OBLIGATION OF THE TAXPAYER, EVEN THOUGH THE ASSESSED DEFICIENCY HAD ITSELF BEEN ABATED.  76 F.SUPP.  937(1948).  THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED, HOLDING THAT THE CARRY-BACK, IN WIPING OUT THE DEBT OF THE TAX DEFICIENCY, MUST ALSO HAVE WIPED OUT THE INTEREST WHICH HAD BEEN ASSESSED ON THAT DEFICIENCY.  172 F.2D 77(1948).  BECAUSE OF THE FREQUENCY OF THE USE OF THE CARRY-BACK PROVISION OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, WE GRANTED CERTIORARI.  [337 U.S. 955][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/337/955](1949).

    THE GENERAL STATUTORY SCHEME WHICH PRESENTS THE PROBLEM IS AS FOLLOWS:  AS OF A CERTAIN DATE THE TAXPAYER HAS A DUTY TO FILE A RETURN FOR THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR AND PAY THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX ACTUALLY DUE FOR THAT YEAR.  FN6  IF THIS RETURN IS ERRONEOUSLY CALCULATED AND THE PAYMENT IS LESS THAN THE TAX PROPERLY DUE, THE COMMISSIONER, USING THE PROCEDURE APPROPRIATE TO THE PARTICULAR SITUATION, MAY ASSESS A DEFICIENCY, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TAX IMPOSED BY LAW AND THE TAX SHOWN UPON THE RETURN.  FN7  INTEREST UPON THIS DEFICIENCY AT THE RATE OF SIX PER CENT FROM THE DATE THE TAX WAS LAWFULLY DUE TO THE DATE OF THE ASSESSMENT IS ASSESSED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE DEFICIENCY.  FN8  IF A NET OPERATING LOSS IS SUBSEQUENTLY SUSTAINED, THAT LOSS MAY BE CARRIED BACK AND ADDED TO THE DEDUCTIONS FOR THE TWO PREVIOUS TAXABLE YEARS, WITH APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS IN THE TAX LIABILITY FOR THOSE YEARS.  THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED IN THIS CASE IS WHETHER THE INTEREST ON A VALIDLY ASSESSED DEFICIENCY IS ABATED WHEN THE DEFICIENCY ITSELF IS ABATED BY THE CARRY-BACK OF A NET OPERATING LOSS.

    WE HOLD THAT THE INTEREST WAS PROPERLY WITHHELD BY THE COLLECTOR.

    THE SUBSEQUENT CANCELLATION OF THE DUTY TO PAY THIS ASSESSED DEFICIENCY DOES NOT CANCEL IN LIKE MANNER THE DUTY TO PAY THE INTEREST ON THAT DEFICIENCY.  FROM THE DATE THE ORIGINAL RETURN WAS TO BE FILED UNTIL THE DATE THE DEFICIENCY WAS ACTUALLY ASSESSED, THE TAXPAYER HAD A POSITIVE OBLIGATION TO THE UNITED STATES:  A DUTY TO PAY ITS TAX.  SEE RODGERS V. UNITED STATES, [332 U.S. 371][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/332/371], 374(1947); UNITED STATES V. CHILDS, [266 U.S. 304][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/266/304], 309-310(1924); BILLINGS V. UNITED STATES, [232 U.S. 261][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/232/261], 285-287(1914).  FOR THAT PERIOD THE TAXPAYER, BY ITS FAILURE TO PAY THE TAXES OWED, HAD THE USE OF FUNDS WHICH RIGHTFULLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE POSSESSION OF THE UNITED STATES.  THE FACT THAT THE STATUTE PERMITS THE TAXPAYER SUBSEQUENTLY TO AVOID THE PAYMENT OF THAT DEBT IN NO WAY INDICATES THAT THE TAXPAYER IS TO DERIVE THE BENEFITS OF THE FUNDS FOR THE INTERVENING PERIOD.  IN THE ABSENCE OF A CLEAR LEGISLATIVE EXPRESSION TO THE CONTRARY, THE QUESTION OF WHO PROPERLY SHOULD POSSESS THE RIGHT OF USE OF THE MONEY OWED THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD IT IS OWED MUST BE ANSWERED IN FAVOR OF THE GOVERNMENT.

    IT IS APPARENT FROM AN INSPECTION OF THE CODE THAT CONGRESS INTENDED THE UNITED STATES TO HAVE THE USE OF THE MONEY LAWFULLY DUE WHEN IT BECAME DUE.  SEVERAL SECTIONS OF THE CODE PRESCRIBE PENALTIES AND ADDITIONS TO THE TAX FOR NEGLIGENCE AND FRAUD.  FN9  A TAXPAYER WHO FILES A TIMELY RETURN BUT DOES NOT PAY THE TAX ON TIME MUST PAY INTEREST ON THE TAX UNTIL PAYMENT.  FN10  EVEN WHEN THE COMMISSIONER, AT THE REQUEST OF THE TAXPAYER, AUTHORIZES AN EXTENSION OF THE TIME OF PAYMENT, INTEREST MUST BE PAID BY THE TAXPAYER FOR THE PERIOD OF THE EXTENSION.  FN11  AND WHEN THE COMMISSIONER ASSESSES A DEFICIENCY HE ALSO MAY ASSESS INTEREST ON THAT DEFICIENCY FROM THE DATE THE TAX WAS DUE TO THE ASSESSMENT DATE.  FN12

    THE ENACTMENT OF THE CARRY-BACK PROVISION IN 1942 DID NOT CHANGE THIS POLICY OF THE STATUTE REQUIRING PROMPT PAYMENT.  THIS SECTION WAS INTENDED TO AFFORD TAXPAYERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT FOR TAX PURPOSES A REALISTIC, BALANCED PICTURE OF THEIR PROFITS AND LOSSES.  IT PERMITS A TAXPAYER TO ADD A NET OPERATING LOSS FOR ONE YEAR TO THE DEDUCTIONS FOR THE TWO PREVIOUS TAXABLE YEARS.  THE REPORT OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE STATES THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE SECTION WAS TO AFFORD RELIEF TO CASES WHERE MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP EXPENSES WERE DEFERRED TO PEACETIME YEARS BECAUSE OF WARTIME RESTRICTIONS.  S. REP. NO. 1631, 77TH CONG., 2D SESS. 51-52(1942).  BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT CONGRESS INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE TAXPAYERS TO CEASE PROMPT PAYMENT OF TAXES.  THE SAME REPORT, EXPLAINING THE OPERATION OF THE SECTION WHICH BECAME THE PRESENT CARRY-BACK PROVISION, STATES, "A TAXPAYER ENTITLED TO A CARRY-BACK OF A NET OPERATING LOSS OR AN UNUSED EXCESS PROFITS CREDIT  ...  WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE DEDUCTION ON ACCOUNT OF SUCH CARRY-BACK UNTIL THE CLOSE OF THE FUTURE TAXABLE YEAR IN WHICH HE SUSTAINS THE NET OPERATING LOSS OR HAS THE UNUSED EXCESS PROFITS CREDIT.  HE MUST THEREFORE FILE HIS RETURN AND PAY HIS TAX WITHOUT REGARD TO SUCH DEDUCTION, AND MUST FILE A CLAIM FOR REFUND AT THE CLOSE OF THE SUCCEEDING TAXABLE YEAR WHEN HE IS ABLE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF SUCH CARRY-BACK."  S. REP. NO. 1631 AT 123-124.  WE CAN IMAGINE NO CLEARER INDICATION OF A CONGRESSIONAL UNDERSTANDING AND INTENT THAT THE CARRY-BACK WAS NOT TO BE INTERPRETED AS DEFERRING OR DELAYING THE PROMPT PAYMENT OF TAXES PROPERLY DUE.

    ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT FOR MANY PURPOSES THE CARRY-BACK IS EQUIVALENT TO A DE NOVO DETERMINATION OF THE TAX, OUR CONCLUSION THAT THIS SECTION DOES NOT RETROACTIVELY ALTER THE DUTY OF A TAXPAYER TO PAY HIS FULL TAX PROMPTLY IS AMPLY SUPPORTED BY SEC. 3771(E) OF THE CODE.

    FN13 THAT SECTION, AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CARRY-BACK PROVISION, PROHIBITS A TAXPAYER WHO DOES PAY A TAX WHICH IS SUBSEQUENTLY ABATED BY A CARRY-BACK FROM CLAIMING INTEREST FROM THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE INTERVENING PERIOD.  IT IS CLEAR, THEREFORE, THAT CONGRESS IN 1942 DID NOT INTEND TO CHANGE THE BASIC STATUTORY POLICY:  THE UNITED STATES IS TO HAVE THE POSSESSION AND USE OF THE LAWFUL TAX AT THE DATE IT IS PROPERLY DUE.

    TO SUSTAIN RESPONDENT'S CONTENTION WOULD BE TO PLACE A PREMIUM ON FAILURE TO CONFORM DILIGENTLY WITH THE LAW.  FOR THEN A TAXPAYER WHO DID NOT PAY HIS TAXES ON TIME WOULD RECEIVE THE FULL USE OF THE TAX FUNDS FOR THE INTERVENING PERIOD, WHILE THE TAXPAYER WHO DID OBEY THE STATUTORY MANDATE AND PAY HIS LAWFUL TAXES PROMPTLY WOULD BE PROHIBITED BY SEC. 3771(E) FROM HAVING THE USE OF THE MONEY FOR THAT PERIOD.  WE CANNOT APPROVE SUCH A RESULT.

    ANY OTHER INTERPRETATION WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE PRESENT STRUCTURE OF THE CODE, AS AMENDED BY SEC. 4(A) OF THE TAX ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1945, [59 STAT. 519][/us/stat/59/519], NOW SECS. 3779 AND 3780 OF THECODE.  PRIOR TO 1945, THE COMMISSIONER HAD POWER TO AUTHORIZE, AT THE REQUEST OF THE TAXPAYER, AN EXTENSION OF TIME FOR THE PAYMENT OF TAXES, AND INTEREST ON SUCH AN EXTENSION WAS CHARGED AT THE RATE OF SIX PER CENT.  FN14 THE TAX ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1945 WAS PASSED TO IMPROVE THE CASH POSITION OF TAXPAYERS BY ALLOWING THEM TO DEFER CURRENT TAX PAYMENTS IF THERE WAS A REASONABLE CHANCE THAT THESE PAYMENTS WOULD BE RETURNED TO THEM IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF BUSINESS LOSSES, AND TO SPEED UP THE REFUND OF TAXES PAID.  H.R. REP. NO. 849, 79TH CONG., 1ST SESS. 1-6(1945); JOINT COMMITTEE ON INTERNAL REVENUE TAXATION, REP. NO. 1, 79TH CONG., 1ST SESS. 6-9(1945).  UNDER SEC. 3779 A CORPORATION FILING ITS RETURN FOR THE PRECEDING TAX YEAR HAS THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN AN EXTENSION OF TIME FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE TAX FOR THAT PRECEDING YEAR.  THIS EXTENSION MAY BE OBTAINED IF THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO SUFFER, IN THE FISCAL YEAR IN WHICH THE RETURN IS FILED, A NET OPERATING LOSS SUFFICIENT TO DIMINISH, BY A CARRY-BACK, ITS TAX LIABILITY FOR THE PRECEDING TAX YEARS.  AT THE CLOSE OF THAT YEAR, THE TAXPAYER MAY FILE, UNDER SEC. 3780, AN APPLICATION FOR A TENTATIVE READJUSTMENT OF TAXES FOR PRECEDING YEARS, INCLUDING A QUICK REFUND OF TAXES PAID OR AN ABATEMENT OF TAXES WHICH HAVE BEEN DEFERRED.  A CORPORATION WHICH DOES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROVISIONS IS NOT COMPLETELY ABSOLVED FROM THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON DEFERRED TAXES ACTUALLY ABATED.  FOR SEC. 3779(I) EXPRESSLY PROVIDES THAT THE CORPORATION MUST PAY THREE PER CENT INTEREST ON DEFERRED TAXES ACTUALLY ABATED BY THE CARRY-BACK AND SIX PER CENT ON THOSE NOT ABATED.  AGAIN IT IS APPARENT THAT THE CODE CONTEMPLATES TIMELY PAYMENT OF TAXES AND SUBSUMES THE RIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE INTERIM USE OF THE TAX PAYMENTS.

    IT IS ARGUED THAT THE CONCLUSION THAT RESPONDENT IS NOT ENTITLED TO A REFUND OF THE ASSESSED INTEREST IS UNFAIR, ALLEGEDLY DISCRIMINATING AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHOSE DEFICIENCY IS ASSESSED UNDER THE ACCELERATED BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURE IN FAVOR OF ONE WHOSE DEFICIENCY IS ASSESSED UNDER SEC. 272(A)(1), THE MORE CUSTOMARY "90-DAY LETTER" TAX COURT PROCEDURE.  THIS SECTION PROVIDES THAT IN THE USUAL CASE THE COMMISSIONER MUST NOTIFY THE TAXPAYER THAT HE INTENDS TO ASSESS A DEFICIENCY AGAINST HIM.  THE TAXPAYER IS THEN ALLOWED NINETY DAYS IN WHICH TO FILE A PETITION WITH THE TAX COURT FOR A REDETERMINATION OF THE ALLEGED DEFICIENCY, AND THE COMMISSIONER IS RESTRAINED FROM ASSESSING ANY DEFICIENCY UNTIL THE DECISION OF THE TAX COURT BECOMES FINAL.  NOR MAY THE COMMISSIONER ASSESS MORE THAN THE AMOUNT THE TAX COURT DETERMINES TO BE THE DIFICIENCY.  SECTION 292(A), PROVIDING FOR INTEREST ON DEFICIENCIES, STATES, "INTEREST UPON THE AMOUNT DETERMINED AS A DEFICIENCY SHALL BE ASSESSED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE DEFICIENCY ...."  THE ARGUMENT IS THAT IF THERE IS NO DEFICIENCY THERE CAN BE NO INTEREST, AND, IT IS FURTHER URGED, THE TAX COURT WILL NORMALLY ARRIVE AT A RESULT OF NO DEFICIENCY, FOR IT WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY-BACK IN ITS REDETERMINATION.  THEREFORE, NO INTEREST WILL BE ASSESSED.

    AT THE TIME OF THE PRINCIPAL ASSESSMENT IN THIS CASE, HOWEVER, THE NET OPERATING LOSS HAD NOT YET BEEN REPORTED.  NOR HAS THE VALIDITY OF THE DEFICIENCY ASSESSMENT BEEN CHALLENGED AT ANY TIME THROUGHOUT THE LITIGATION.  THUS, THE COMPARABLE SITUATION TO THE INSTANT CASE WOULD BE, IF, BEFORE THE NET OPERATING LOSS WAS CLAIMED, THE TAX COURT WAS CONFRONTED WITH A DEFICIENCY DETERMINED BY THE COMMISSIONER.  WE SEE NO REASON WHY THAT METHOD OF ASSESSMENT, OR ANY OF THE OTHERS AUTHORIZED BY STATUTE, WOULD ARRIVE AT A DIFFERENT FIGURE BECAUSE OF AN UNCLAIMED NET OPERATING LOSS.  WHETHER THE LANGUAGE OF THE CODE REQUIRES A DEFFERENT RESULT WHEN THE LOSS IS CLAIMED BEFORE THE ATTEMPTED ASSESSMENT OF THE DEFICIENCY IS A QUESTION WHICH IS NOT CONSIDERED BY US ON THIS RECORD.  WE HOLD THAT WHERE A DEFICIENCY AND INTEREST HAVE BEEN VALIDLY ASSESSED UNDER ANY APPLICABLE STATUTORY PROCEDURE, A SUBSEQUENT CARRY-BACK WITH AN ABATEMENT OF THE DEFICIENCY DOES NOT ABATE THE INTEREST PREVIOUSLY ASSESSED ON THAT DEFICIENCY.

    RESPONDENT ALSO PLACES GREAT RELIANCE ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT "INTEREST IS AN ACCRETION TO AND PART OF THE TAX," AND, THEREFORE, MUST BE ABATED WHEN THE TAX IS ABATED.  THE CASES TO WHICH WE HAVE BEEN REFERRED IN SUPPORT OF THIS PRINCIPLE DEAL WITH COMPROMISES OF TAXES WHICH WERE INCORRECTLY ASSESSED AT THE OUTSET, AND NOT, AS HERE, WITH A SUBSEQUENT ABATEMENT OF A TAX CORRECTLY ASSESSED.  AS SUCH, THEY ARE NOT PERSUASIVE OF A CONTRARY RESULT.

    TWO ADMINISTRATIVE RULINGS  FN15  ON THE CARRY-BACK PROVISION OF THEREVENUE ACT OF 1918, [40 STAT. 1057][/us/stat/40/1057], ARE CITED AS OPPOSED TO THIS INTERPRETATION OF THE CODE.  WE SEE NO NEED TO DISTINGUISH THESE REGULATIONS OR DECISIONS.  TWO RULINGS RELATING TO A CARRY-BACK SECTION OF TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO, NOT REPEATED IN THE INTERVENING QUARTERCENTURY, ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO FORCE US TO CONCLUDE THAT CONGRESS INTENDED TO IMPART THEIR CONSTRUCTION OF THAT SECTION TO THE PRESENT PROVISION.    WE HAVE CONSIDERED THE REMAINDER OF THE POINTS RAISED BY THE COURT BELOW AND RESPONDENT, BUT FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS ARE IN ACCORD THAT THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF APPEALS MUST BE REVERSED AND THE JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT AFFIRMED.  REVERSED.

    FN1  THE PAYMENT IN QUESTION INCLUDED CORPORATE INCOME TAX, DEFENSE TAX AND EXCESS PROFITS TAX.  NO QUESTION IS PRESENTED AS TO THE CORRECTNESS OF THE DEFENSE TAX PAYMENT.

    FN2  INT. REV. CODE SEC. 274(A):  "UPON THE ADJUDICATION OF BANKRUPTCY OF ANY TAXPAYER IN ANY BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING OR THE APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER FOR ANY TAXPAYER IN ANY RECEIVERSHIP PROCEEDING BEFORE ANY COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OR OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OR OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, ANY DEFICIENCY (TOGETHER WITH ALL INTEREST, ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, OR ADDITIONS TO THE TAX PROVIDED FOR BY LAW) DETERMINED BY THE COMMISSIONER IN RESPECT OF A TAX IMPOSED BY THIS CHAPTER UPON SUCH TAXPAYER SHALL, DESPITE THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY SECTION 272(A) UPON ASSESSMENTS BE IMMEDIATELY ASSESSED IF SUCH DEFICIENCY HAS NOT THERETOFORE BEEN ASSESSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW.

    IN SUCH CASES THE TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVER SHALL GIVE NOTICE IN WRITING TO THE COMMISSIONER OF THE ADJUDICATION OF BANKRUPTCY OR THE APPOINTMENT OF THE RECEIVER, AND THE RUNNING OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON THE MAKING OF ASSESSMENTS SHALL BE SUSPENDED FOR THE PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF ADJUDICATION IN BANKRUPTCY OR THE APPOINTMENT OF THE RECEIVER TO A DATE 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE UPON WHICH THE NOTICE FROM THE TRUSTEE OR RECEIVER IS RECEIVED BY THE COMMISSIONER; BUT THE SUSPENSION UNDER THIS SENTENCE SHALL IN NO CASE BE FOR A PERIOD IN EXCESS OF TWO YEARS.  CLAIMS FOR THE DEFICIENCY AND SUCH INTEREST, ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS AND ADDITIONS TO THE TAX MAY BE PRESENTED, FOR ADJUDICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW, TO THE COURT BEFORE WHICH THE BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVERSHIP PROCEEDING IS PENDING, DESPITE THE PENDENCY OF PROCEEDINGS FOR THE REDETERMINATION OF THE DEFICIENCY IN PURSUANCE OF A PETITION TO THE TAX COURT; BUT NO PETITION FOR ANY SUCH REDETERMINATION SHALL BE FILED WITH THE TAX COURT AFTER THE ADJUDICATION OF BANKRUPTCY OR THE APPOINTMENT OF THE RECEIVER."

    FN3  DEFICIENCIES WERE ASSESSED BOTH AS TO THE NORMAL INCOME TAX AND AS TO THE EXCESS PROFITS TAX.

    FURTHER DEFICIENCIES WERE ASSESSED MARCH 21, 1944.  THE INTEREST ON THESE DEFICIENCIES AMOUNTED TO $82.66, WHEREAS THE INTEREST ON THE DEFICIENCIES ASSESSED IN AUGUST, 1943, TOTALED $4,430.68.  WE FEEL THAT ANY POSSIBLE DIFFERENCE IN RESULT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TIMING OF THE ASSESSMENT HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON THE AMOUNT TO WHICH TAXPAYER MIGHT BE ENTITLED IN THIS CASE, AND WE DO NOT CONSIDER THIS FACTOR.

    THE RECORD IS BARE OF ANY CLAIM OR PAYMENT OF INTEREST FROM THE DATE OF THE ASSESSMENT OF THE DEFICIENCY UNTIL THE DATE OF THE CLAIM OF THE REFUND.  SEE INT. REV. CODE SEC. 294(B).

    RESPONDENT DOES NOT URGE AND WE NEED NOT DECIDE THE APPLICABILITY OF CITY OF NEW YORK V. SAPER, [336 U.S. 328][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/336/328](1949), WHERE WE HELD THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT CASE, BANKRUPTCY TERMINATED THE RUNNING OF INTEREST ON CLAIMS AGAINST THE BANKRUPT.  IN VIEW OF THE FACTS THAT RESPONDENT WAS REVESTED WITH TITLE TO ITS ASSETS ON JUNE 4, 1945, AND THAT THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE BANKRUPTCY AND THE MAJOR PART OF THE ASSESSMENT WAS LESS THAN A MONTH, WE DO NOT FEEL THAT THE HOLDING OF THAT CASE COULD EFFECT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE DISPOSITION OF THE PROBLEM AT HAND.

    FN4  INT. REV. CODE SEC. 122(A):  "AS USED IN THIS SECTION, THE TERM 'NET OPERATING LOSS' MEANS THE EXCESS OF THE DEDUCTIONS ALLOWED BY THIS CHAPTER OVER THE GROSS INCOME, WITH THE EXCEPTIONS, ADDITIONS, AND LIMITATIONS PROVIDED IN SUBSECTION (D)."

    FN5  INT. REV. CODE SEC. 122(B)(1):  "IF FOR ANY TAXABLE YEAR BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 1941, THE TAXPAYER HAS A NET OPERATING LOSS, SUCH NET OPERATING LOSS SHALL BE A NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY-BANK FOR EACH OF THE TWO PRECEDING TAXABLE YEARS,  ...."

    THE CARRY-BACK OPERATED SIMILARLY ON THE EXCESS PROFITS TAX.  26 U.S.C. SECS. 710, 728, 729(1946).  THE ENTIRE EXCESS PROFITS SECTION OF THE CODE, PASSED IN 1940, [54 STAT. 975][/us/stat/54/975], WAS REPEALED IN 1945, [59 STAT. 568][/us/stat/59/568].

    FN6  SEE INT. REV. CODE SECS. 52(A), 53(A), 56(A).  THE TAX MAY ALSO BE PAID IN QUARTERLY INSTALLMENTS.  INT. REV. CODE SEC. 56(B).

    FN7  INT. REV. CODE SEC. 271(A).

    FN8  INT. REV. CODE SEC. 292(A).

    FN9  E.G., INT. REV. CODE SECS. 291(A), 293(A), (B).

    FN10  INT. REV. CODE SEC. 294(A)(1).

    FN11  INT. REV. CODE SECS. 56(C)(1), 295.

    FN12  INT. REV. CODE SEC. 292(A).

    FN13  INT. REV. CODE SEC. 3771(E):  "IF THE COMMISSIONER DETERMINES THAT ANY PART OF AN OVERPAYMENT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCLUSION IN COMPUTING THE NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTION FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR OF ANY PART OF THE NET OPERATING LOSS FOR A SUCCEEDING TAXABLE YEAR OR TO THE INCLUSION IN COMPUTING THE UNUSED EXCESS PROFITS CREDIT ADJUSTMENT FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR OF ANY PART OF THE UNUSED EXCESS PROFITS CREDIT FOR A SUCCEEDING TAXABLE YEAR, NO INTEREST SHALL BE ALLOWED OR PAID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PART OF THE OVERPAYMENT FOR ANY PERIOD BEFORE THE FILING OF A CLAIM FOR CREDIT OR REFUND OF SUCH PART OF THE OVERPAYMENT OR THE FILING OF A PETITION WITH THE TAX COURT, WHICHEVER IS EARLIER; ...."

    FN14  INT. REV. CODE SECS. 56(C), 295.

    FN15  L. O. 1115, II-2 CUM. BULL.  221(1923); I.T. 1447, I-2 CUM. BULL.  220(1922).

    MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS TOOK NO PART IN THE CONSIDERATION OR DECISION OF THIS CASE.
