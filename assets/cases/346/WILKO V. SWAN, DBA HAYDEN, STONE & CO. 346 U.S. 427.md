WILKO V. SWAN, DBA HAYDEN, STONE & CO. 346 U.S. 427

NO. 39.  ARGUED OCTOBER 21, 1953 - DECIDED DECEMBER 7, 1953 - 201 F.2D 439, REVERSED.

IN AN ACTION BROUGHT BY A CUSTOMER AGAINST A SECURITIES BROKERAGE FIRM TO RECOVER DAMAGES, UNDER THE CIVIL LIABILITIES PROVISIONS OF SEC. 12(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, FOR ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATION IN THE SALE OF SECURITIES, HELD THAT AN AGREEMENT FOR ARBITRATION OF ANY CONTROVERSY ARISING IN THE FUTURE BETWEEN THE PARTIES WAS VOID UNDER SEC. 14, NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF THE UNITED STATES ARBITRATION ACT.  PP. 428-438.

(A)  THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE FUTURE CONTROVERSIES WAS VOID UNDER SEC. 14 OF THE SECURITIES ACT AS A "STIPULATION" BINDING THE CUSTOMER TO "WAIVE COMPLIANCE" WITH A "PROVISIONS" OF THE ACT.  PP. 432-435.

(B)  THE RIGHT OF AN AGGRIEVED PERSON UNDER SEC. 22(A) TO SELECT THE JUDICIAL FORUM IS A "PROVISION" OF THE SECURITIES ACT THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED UNDER SEC. 14 THEREOF.  PP. 434-438.

(C)  AS THE PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES ACT REQUIRE THE EXERCISE OF JUDICIAL DIRECTION TO FAIRLY ASSURE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS, CONGRESS MUST HAVE INTENDED SEC. 14 TO APPLY TO WAIVER OF JUDICIAL TRIAL AND REVIEW.  P. 437.

WILKO V. SWAN ET AL., DOING BUSINESS AS HAYDEN, STONE & CO., ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

PETITIONER SUED RESPONDENTS TO RECOVER DAMAGES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.  RESPONDENTS' MOTION TO STAY THE ACTION, PURSUANT TO SEC. 3 OF THE UNITED STATES ARBITRATION ACT, WAS DENIED BY THE DISTRICT COURT.  107 F. SUPP. 75.  THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED.  201 F.2D 439.  THIS COURT GRANTED CERTIORARI.  345 U.S. 969.  REVERSED, P. 438.

MR. JUSTICE REED DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

THIS ACTION BY PETITIONER,\* A CUSTOMER, AGAINST RESPONDENTS, PARTNERS IN A SECURITIES BROKERAGE FIRM, WAS BROUGHT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, TO RECOVER DAMAGES UNDER SEC. 12(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.  (FN1)  THE COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 17, 1951, THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITIES OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE, PETITIONER WAS INDUCED BY HAYDEN, STONE AND COMPANY TO PURCHASE 1,600 SHARES OF THE COMMON STOCK OF AIR ASSOCIATES, INCORPORATED, BY FALSE REPRESENTATIONS THAT PURSUANT TO A MERGER CONTRACT WITH THE BORG WARNER CORPORATION, AIR ASSOCIATES' STOCK WOULD BE VALUED AT $6.00 PER SHARE OVER THE THEN CURRENT MARKET PRICE, AND THAT FINANCIAL INTERESTS WERE BUYING UP THE STOCK FOR THE SPECULATIVE PROFIT.  IT WAS ALLEGED THAT HE WAS NOT TOLD THAT HAVEN B. PAGE (ALSO NAMED AS A DEFENDANT BUT NOT INVOLVED IN THIS REVIEW (FN2)), A DIRECTOR OF, AND COUNSEL FOR, AIR ASSOCIATES WAS THEN SELLING HIS OWN AIR ASSOCIATES' STOCK, INCLUDING SOME OR ALL THAT PETITIONER PURCHASED.  TWO WEEKS AFTER THE PRUCHASE, PETITIONER DISPOSED OF THE STOCK AT A LOSS.  CLAIMING THAT THE LOSS WAS DUE TO THE FIRM'S MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSION OF INFORMATION CONCERNING MR. PAGE, HE SOUGHT DAMAGES.

\*THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PARTICIPATED AS AMICUS CURIAE THROUGHOUT THIS CASE AND HAS SHARED PETITIONER'S BURDEN IN PRESENTING THE CASE TO THE COURT.

WITHOUT ANSWERING THE COMPLAINT, THE RESPONDENT MOVED TO STAY THE TRIAL OF THE ACTION PURSUANT TO SEC. 3 OF THE UNITED STATES ARBITRATION ACT (FN3) UNTIL AN ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF IDENTICAL MARGIN AGREEMENTS WAS HAD.  AN AFFIDAVIT ACCOMPANIED THE MOTION STATING THAT THE PARTIES' RELATIONSHIP WAS CONTROLLED BY THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS AND THAT WHILE THE FIRM WAS WILLING TO ARBITRATE PETITIONER HAD FAILED TO SEEK OR PROCEED WITH ANY ARBITRATION OF THE CONTROVERSY.

FINDING THAT THE MARGIN AGREEMENTS PROVIDE THAT ARBITRATION SHOULD BE THE METHOD OF SETTLING ALL FUTURE CONTROVERSIES, THE DISTRICT COURT HELD THAT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DEPRIVED PETITIONER OF THE ADVANTAGEOUS COURT REMEDY AFFORDED BY THE SECURITIES ACT, AND DENIED THE STAY.  (FN4)  A DIVIDED COURT OF APPEALS CONCLUDED THAT THE ACT DID NOT PROHIBIT THE AGREEMENT TO REFER FUTURE CONTROVERSIES TO ARBITRATION, AND REVERSED.  (FN5)

THE QUESTION IS WHETHER AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE A FUTURE CONTROVERSY IS A "CONDITION, STIPULATION, OR PROVISION BINDING ANY PERSON ACQUIRING ANY SECURITY TO WAIVE COMPLAINCE WITH ANY PROVISION" OF THE SECURITIES ACT WHICH SEC. 14 (FN6) DECLARES "VOID."  WE GRANTED CERTIORARI, 345 U.S. 969, TO REVIEW THIS IMPORTANT AND NOVEL FEDERAL QUESTION AFFECTING BOTH THE SECURITIES ACT AND THE UNITED STATES ARBITRATION ACT.  CF. FROST & CO. V. COEUR D'ALENE MINES CORP., 312 U.S. 38, 40.

AS THE MARGIN AGREEMENT IN THE LIGHT OF THE COMPLAINT EVIDENCED A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE, NO ISSUE ARISES AS TO THE APPLICABILITY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE UNITED STATES ARBITRATION ACT TO THIS SUIT, BASED UPON THE SECURITIES ACT.  9 U.S.C. (SUPP.  V, 1952) SEC. 2.  CF. TEJAS DEVELOPMENT CO. V. MCGOUGH BROS., 165 F.2D 276, 278, WITH AGOSTINI BROS. BLDG. CORP. V. UNITED STATES, 142 F.2D 854.  SEE STURGES AND MURPHY, SOME CONFUSING MATTERS RELATING TO ARBITRATION, 17 LAW & CONTEMP.  PROB.  580.

IN RESPONSE TO A PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE URGING THAT THERE BE ADDED TO THE ANCIENT RULE OF CAVEAT EMPTOR THE FURTHER DOCTRINE OF "LET THE SELLER ALSO BEWARE," (FN7) CONGRESS PASSED THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.

DESIGNED TO PROTECT INVESTORS, (FN8) THE ACT REQUIRES ISSUERS, UNDERWRITERS, AND DEALERS TO MAKE FULL AND FAIR DISCLOSURE OF THE CHARACTER OF SECURITIES SOLD IN INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE AND TO PREVENT FRAUD IN THEIR SALE.  (FN9)  TO EFFECTUATE THIS POLICY, SEC. 12(2) CREATED A SPECIAL RIGHT TO RECOVER FOR MISREPRESENTATION WHICH DIFFERS SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE COMMON-LAW ACTION IN THAT THE SELLER IS MADE TO ASSUME THE BURDEN OF PROVING LACK OF SCIENTER.  (FN10)  THE ACT'S SPECIAL RIGHT IS ENFORCEABLE IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION - FEDERAL OR STATE - AND REMOVAL FROM A STATE COURT IS PROHIBITED.  IF SUIT BE BROUGHT IN A FEDERAL COURT, THE PURCHASER HAS A WIDE CHOICE OF VENUE, THE PRIVILEGE OF NATION-WIDE SERVICE OF PROCESS AND THE JURISDICTIONAL $3,000 REQUIREMENT OF DIVERSITY CASES IS INAPPLICABLE.  (FN11)

THE UNITED STATES ARBITRATION ACT ESTABLISHES BY STATUTE THE DESIRABILITY OF ARBITRATION AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE COMPLICATIONS OF LITIGATION.  THE REPORTS OF BOTH HOUSES ON THAT ACT STRESS THE NEED FOR AVOIDING THE DELAY AND EXPENSE OF LITIGATION, (FN12) AND PRACTICE UNDER ITS TERMS RAISES HOPE FOR ITS USEFULNESS BOTH IN CONTROVERSIES BASED ON STATUTES (FN13) OR ON STANDARDS OTHERWISE CREATED.  (FN14)  THIS HOSPITABLE ATTITUDE OF LEGISLATURES AND COURTS TOWARD ARBITRATION, HOWEVER, DOES NOT SOLVE OUR QUESTION AS TO THE VALIDITY OF PETITIONER'S STIPULATION BY THE MARGIN AGREEMENTS, SET OUT BELOW, TO SUBMIT TO ARBITRATION CONTROVERSIES THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM THE TRANSACTIONS.

(FN15)

PETITIONER ARGUES THAT SEC. 14, NOTE 6, SUPRA, SHOWS THAT THE PURPOSE OF CONGRESS WAS TO ASSURE THAT SELLERS COULD NOT MANEUVER BUYERS INTO A POSITION THAT MIGHT WEAKEN THEIR ABILITY TO RECOVER UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.  HE CONTENDS THAT ARBITRATION LACKS THE CERTAINTY OF A SUIT AT LAW UNDER THE ACT TO ENFORCE HIS RIGHTS.  HE REASONS THAT THE ARBITRATION PARAGRAPH OF THE MARGIN AGREEMENT IS A STIPULATION THAT WIAVES "COMPLIANCE WITH" THE PROVISION OF THE SECURITIES ACT, SET OUT IN THE MARGIN, CONFERRING JURISDICTION OF SUITS AND SPECIAL POWERS.

(FN16)

RESPONDENT ASSERTS THAT ARBITRATION IS MERELY A FORM OF TRIAL TO BE USED IN LIEU OF A TRIAL AT LAW, (FN17) AND THEREFORE NO CONFLICT EXISTS BETWEEN THE SECURITIES ACT AND THE UNITED STATES ARBITRATION ACT EITHER IN THEIR LANGUAGE OR IN THE CONGRESSIONAL PURPOSES IN THEIR ENACTMENT.

EACH MAY FUNCTION WITHIN ITS OWN SCOPE, THE FORMER TO PROTECT INVESTORS AND THE LATTER TO SIMPLIFY RECOVERY FOR ACTIONABLE VIOLATIONS OF LAW BY ISSUERS OR DEALERS IN SECURITIES.

RESPONDENT IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS THAT THE MARGIN AGREEMENT ARBITRATION PARAGRAPH, NOTE 15, SUPRA, DOES NOT RELIEVE THE SELLER FROM EITHER LIABILITY OR BURDEN OF PROOF, NOTE 1, SUPRA, IMPOSED BY THE SECURITIES ACT.  (FN18)  WE AGREE THAT IN SO FAR AS THE AWARD IN ARBITRATION MAY BE AFFECTED BY LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, STATUTES OR COMMON LAW, RATHER THAN BY CONSIDERATIONS OF FAIRNESS, THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES ACT CONTROL.  (FN19)  THIS IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH THIS PROPOSED AGREEMENT HAS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE ARBITRATORS FOLLOW THE LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES AS TO THE EFFECT OF THE SECURITIES ACT INCLUDES ALSO ACCEPTANCE OF THE INVALIDITY OF THE PARAGRAPH OF THE MARGIN AGREEMENT THAT RELIEVES THE RESPONDENT SELLERS OF LIABILITY FOR ALL "REPRESENTATION OR ADVICE BY YOU OR YOUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS REGARDING THE PURCHASE OR SALE BY ME OF ANY PROPERTY  ...  ."

THE WORDS OF SEC. 14, NOTE 6, SUPRA, VOID ANY "STIPULATION" WAIVING COMPLIANCE WITH ANY "PROVISION" OF THE SECURITIES ACT.  THIS ARRANGEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS A "STIPULATION," AND WE THINK THE RIGHT TO SELECT THE JUDICIAL FORUM IS THE KIND OF "PROVISION" THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED UNDER SEC. 14 OF THE SECURITIES ACT.  THAT CONCLUSION IS REACHED FOR THE REASONS SET OUT ABOVE IN THE STATEMENT OF PETITIONER'S CONTENTION ON THIS REVIEW.  WHILE A BUYER AND SELLER OF SECURITIES, UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, MAY DEAL AT ARM'S LENGTH ON EQUAL TERMS, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SECURITIES ACT WAS DRAFTED WITH AN EYE TO THE DISADVANTAGES UNDER WHICH BUYERS LABOR.  ISSUERS OF AND DEALERS IN SECURITIES HAVE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO INVESTIGATE AND APPRAISE THE PROSPECTIVE EARNINGS AND BUSINESS PLANS AFFECTING SECURITIES THAN BUYERS.  IT IS THEREFORE REASONABLE FOR CONGRESS TO PUT BUYERS OF SECURITIES COVERED BY THAT ACT ON A DIFFERENT BASIS FROM OTHER PURCHASERS.

WHEN THE SECURITY BUYER, PRIOR TO ANY VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT, WAIVES HIS RIGHT TO SUE IN COURTS, HE GIVES UP MORE THAN WOULD A PARTICIPANT IN OTHER BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS.  THE SECURITY BUYER HAS A WIDER CHOICE OF COURTS AND VENUE.  HE THUS SURRENDERS ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES THE ACT GIVES HIM AND SURRENDERS IT AT A TIME WHEN HE IS LESS ABLE TO JUDGE THE WEIGHT OF THE HANDICAP THE SECURITIES ACT PLACES UPON HIS ADVERSARY.

EVEN THOUGH THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES ACT, ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE BUYER, APPLY, THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN APPLICATION IS LESSENED IN ABITRATION AS COMPARED TO JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.  DETERMINATION OF THE QUALITY OF A COMMODITY (FN20) OR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY DUE UNDER A CONTRACT IS NOT THE TYPE OF ISSUE HERE INVOLVED.  (FN21)  THIS CASE REQUIRES SUBJECTIVE FINDINGS ON THE PURPOSE AND KNOWLEDGE OF AN ALLEGED VIOLATOR OF THE ACT.  THEY MUST BE NOT ONLY DETERMINED BUT APPLIED BY THE ARBITRATORS WITHOUT JUDICIAL INSTRUCTION ON THE LAW.  AS THEIR AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT EXPLANATION OF THEIR REASONS AND WITHOUT A COMPLETE RECORD OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS, THE ARBITRATORS' CONCEPTION OF THE LEGAL MEANING OF SUCH STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AS "BURDEN OF PROOF," "REASONABLE CARE" OR "MATERIAL FACT," SEE NOTE 1, SUPRA, CANNOT BE EXAMINED.  POWER TO VACATE AN AWARD IS LIMITED.  (FN22)  WHILE IT MAY BE TRUE, AS THE COURT OF APPEALS THOUGHT, THAT A FAILURE OF THE ARBITRATORS TO DECIDE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES ACT WOULD "CONSTITUTE GROUNDS FOR VACATING THE AWARD PURSUANT TO SECTION 10 OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT," (FN23) THAT FAILURE WOULD NEED TO BE MADE CLEARLY TO APPEAR.  IN UNRESTRICTED SUBMISSIONS, SUCH AS THE PRESENT MARGIN AGREEMENTS ENVISAGE, THE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW BY THE ARBITRATORS IN CONTRAST TO MANIFEST DISREGARD ARE NOT SUBJECT, IN THE FEDERAL COURTS, TO JUDICIAL REVIEW FOR ERROR IN INTERPRETATION.  (FN24)  THE UNITED STATES ARBITRATION ACT CONTAINS NO PROVISION FOR JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF LEGAL ISSUES SUCH AS IS FOUND IN THE ENGLISH LAW.  (FN25)  AS THE PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS OF THE SECURITIES ACT REQUIRE THE EXERCISE OF JUDICIAL DIRECTION TO FAIRLY ASSURE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS, IT SEEMS TO US THAT CONGRESS MUST HAVE INTENDED SEC. 14, NOTE 6, SUPRA, TO APPLY TO WAIVER OF JUDICIAL TRIAL AND REVIEW.  (FN26)

THIS ACCORDS WITH BOYD V. GRAND TRUNK WESTERN R. CO. 338 U.S. 263.

(FN27)  WE THERE HELD INVALID A STIPULATION RESTRICTING AN EMPLOYEE'S CHOICE OF VENUE IN AN ACTION UNDER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY ACT.  SECTION 6 OF THAT ACT PERMITTED SUIT IN ANY ONE OF SEVERAL LOCALITIES AND SEC. 5 FORBADE A COMMON CARRIER'S EXEMPTING ITSELF FROM ANY LIABILITY UNDER THE ACT.  (FN28) SECTION 5 HAD BEEN ADOPTED TO AVOID CONTRACTS WAIVING EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY.  (FN29)  IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT IN WORDS IT FORBADE EXEMPTION ONLY FROM "LIABILITY."  WE SAID THE RIGHT TO SELECT THE "FORUM" EVEN AFTER THE CREATION OF A LIABILITY IS A "SUBSTANTIAL RIGHT" AND THAT THE AGREEMENT, RESTRICTING THAT CHOICE, WOULD THWART THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE.  WE NEED NOT AND DO NOT GO SO FAR IN THIS PRESENT CASE.  BY THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, PETITIONER IS RESTRICTED IN HIS CHOICE OF FORUM PRIOR TO THE EXISTENCE OF A CONTROVERSY.  WHILE THE SECURITIES ACT DOES NOT REQUIRE PETITIONER TO SUE, (FN30) A WAIVER IN ADVANCE OF A CONTROVERSY STANDS UPON A DIFFERENT FOOTING.  (FN31)

TWO POLICIES, NOT EASILY RECONCILABLE, ARE INVOLVED IN THIS CASE.

CONGRESS HAS AFFORDED PARTICIPANTS IN TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO ITS LEGISLATIVE POWER AN OPPORTUNITY GENERALLY TO SECURE PROMPT, ECONOMICAL AND ADEQUATE SOLUTION OF CONTROVERSIES THROUGH ARBITRATION IF THE PARTIES ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT LESS CERTAINTY OF LEGALLY CORRECT ADJUSTMENT.  (FN32)  ON THE OTHER HAND, IT HAS ENACTED THE SECURITIES ACT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF INVESTORS AND HAS FORBIDDEN A WAIVER OF ANY OF THOSE RIGHTS.  RECOGNIZING THE ADVANTAGES THAT PRIOR AGREEMENTS FOR ARBITRATION MAY PROVIDE FOR THE SOLUTION OF COMMERCIAL CONTROVERSIES, WE DECIDE THAT THE INTENTION OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE SALE OF SECURITIES IS BETTER CARRIED OUT BY HOLDING INVALID SUCH AN AGREEMENT FOR ARBITRATION OF ISSUES ARISING UNDER THE ACT.  REVERSED.

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON, CONCURRING.

I AGREE WITH THE COURT'S OPINION INSOFAR AS IT CONSTRUES THE SECURITIES ACT TO PROHIBIT WAIVER OF A JUDICIAL REMEDY IN FAVOR OF ARBITRATION BY AGREEMENT MADE BEFORE ANY CONTROVERSY AROSE.  I THINK THEREAFTER THE PARTIES COULD AGREE UPON ARBITRATION.  HOWEVER, I FIND IT UNNECESSARY IN THIS CASE, WHERE THERE HAS NOT BEEN AND COULD NOT BE ANY ARBITRATION, TO DECIDE THAT THE ARBITRATION ACT PRECLUDES ANY JUDICIAL REMEDY FOR THE ARBITRATORS' ERROR OF INTERPRETATION OF A RELEVANT STATUTE.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, WHOM MR. JUSTICE MINTON JOINS, DISSENTING.

IF ARBITRATION INHERENTLY PRECLUDED FULL PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS SEC. 12(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT AFFORDS TO A PURCHASER OF SECURITIES, OR IF THERE WERE NO EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ENSURING JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE ARBITRATION, THEN, OF COURSE, AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE CONTROVERSY BY ARBITRATION WOULD BE BARRED BY SEC. 14, THE ANTI WAIVER PROVISION, OF THAT ACT.

THERE IS NOTHING IN THE RECORD BEFORE US, NOR IN THE FACTS OF WHICH WE CAN TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE, TO INDICATE THAT THE ARBITRAL SYSTEM AS PRACTICED IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, AND AS ENFORCEABLE UNDER THE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OF THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, WOULD NOT AFFORD THE PLAINTIFF THE RIGHTS TO WHICH HE IS ENTITLED.\*

\*UNDER THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION, AVAILABLE TO THE PLAINTIFF UNDER HIS CONTRACT, THE PROCEDURE FOR SELECTION OF ARBITRATORS IS AS FOLLOWS:

THE ASSOCIATION SUBMITS A LIST OF POTENTIAL ARBITRATORS QUALIFIED BY EXPERIENCE TO ADJUDICATE THE PARTICULAR CONTROVERSY.  IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, THE LIST WOULD BE DRAWN FROM A PANEL OF 4,400 PERSONS, 1,275 OF WHOM ARE LAWYERS.  EACH PARTY MAY STRIKE OFF THE NAMES OF ANY UNACCEPTABLE PERSONS AND NUMBER THE REMAINING IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE.

THE ASSOCIATION THEN DESIGNATES THE ARBITRATORS ON THE BASIS OF THE PREFERENCES EXPRESSED BY BOTH PARTIES.  SEE "QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS," PAMPHLET OF AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION.  IN SHORT, THOSE WHO ARE CHARGED TO ENFORCE THE RIGHTS ARE SELECTED BY THE PARTIES THEMSELVES FROM AMONG THOSE QUALIFIED TO DECIDE.

THE IMPELLING CONSIDERATIONS THAT LED TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF PROVIDING A SPEEDIER, MORE ECONOMICAL AND MORE EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHTS BY WAY OF ARBITRATION THAN CAN BE HAD BY THE TORTUOUS COURSE OF LITIGATION, ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK.  THESE ADVANTAGES SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED TO BE DENIED IN CONTROVERSIES LIKE THAT BEFORE US ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY SHOWING THAT SETTLEMENT BY ARBITRATION WOULD JEOPARDIZE THE RIGHTS OF THE PLAINTIFF.

ARBITRATORS MAY NOT DISREGARD THE LAW.  SPECIFICALLY THEY ARE, AS CHIEF JUDGE SWAN POINTED OUT, "BOUND TO DECIDE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 12(2)."  ON THIS WE ARE ALL AGREED.  IT IS SUGGESTED, HOWEVER, THAT THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE WAY OF ASSURING OBEDIENCE BY THE ARBITRATORS TO THE GOVERNING LAW.  BUT SINCE THEIR FAILURE TO OBSERVE THIS LAW "WOULD  ...  CONSTITUTE GROUNDS FOR VACATING THE AWARD PURSUANT TO SECTION 10 OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT," 201 F.2D 439, 445, APPROPRIATE MEANS FOR JUDICIAL SCRUTINY MUST BE IMPLIED, IN THE FORM OF SOME RECORD OR OPINION, HOWEVER INFORMAL, WHEREBY SUCH COMPLIANCE WILL APPEAR, OR WANT OF IT WILL UPSET THE AWARD.

WE HAVE NOT BEFORE US A CASE IN WHICH THE RECORD SHOWS THAT THE PLAINTIFF IN OPENING AN ACCOUNT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THE ARBITRATION STIPULATION, THEREBY MAKING THE STIPULATION AN UNCONSCIONABLE AND UNENFORCEABLE PROVISION IN A BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AS AMICUS CURIAE, DOES NOT CONTEND THAT THE STIPULATION WHICH THE COURT OF APPEALS RESPECTED, UNDER THE APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS DEFINED BY IT, WAS A COERCIVE PRACTICE BY FINANCIAL HOUSES AGAINST CUSTOMERS INCAPABLE OF SELF-PROTECTION.  IT IS ONE THING TO MAKE OUT A CASE OF OVERREACHING AS BETWEEN PARTIES BARGAINING NOT AT ARM'S LENGTH.  IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT THING TO FIND IN THE ANTI-WAIVER PROVISION OF THE SECURITIES ACT A GENERAL LIMITATION ON THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.    ON THE STATE OF THE RECORD BEFORE US, I WOULD AFFIRM THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS.
