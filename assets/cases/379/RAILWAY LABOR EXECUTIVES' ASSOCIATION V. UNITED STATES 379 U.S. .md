FOR THIS REASON, THE MOTION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT IS DENIED.

APPELLANTS' MOTION TO LIMIT THE APPEAL TO QUESTIONS RELATED TO SECS. 4, 5, AND 9 OF THE WASHINGTON JOB PROTECTION AGREEMENT IS GRANTED.  THE JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT IS VACATED INSOFAR AS IT RELATES TO SECS. 4, 5, AND 9 OF THE WASHINGTON AGREEMENT, AND THIS CASE IS REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND IT TO THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO AMEND ITS REPORTS AND ORDERS AS NECESSARY TO DEAL WITH APPELLANTS' REQUEST THAT SECS. 4, 5, AND 9 BE INCLUDED AS PROTECTIVE CONDITIONS, SPECIFICALLY INDICATING WHY EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS EITHER OMITTED OR INCLUDED.
