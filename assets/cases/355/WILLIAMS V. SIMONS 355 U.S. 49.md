    WILLIAMS V. SIMONS [355 U.S. 49][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/355/49]

    NO. 74, MISC.  DECIDED NOVEMBER 18, 1957.

    A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT ISSUED A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER RESTRAINING THE GOVERNOR AND OTHER OFFICIALS OF MICHIGAN FROM CONTINUING WITH PROCEEDINGS UNDER STATE LAW FOR THE REMOVAL OF CERTAIN MUNICIPAL OFFICERS FOR ALLEGED MISFEASANCE IN OFFICE.  WITHOUT PASSING ON THE MERITS OF THE COMPLAINT OR A MOTION TO DISMISS IT, A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT, CONVENED TO CONSIDER THE CASE, CONTINUED THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER IN EFFECT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, PENDING DETERMINATION OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE SAME MUNICIPAL OFFICERS.  THE GOVERNOR AND ATTORNEY GENERAL FILED A MOTION IN THIS COURT FOR LEAVE TO FILE A PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS OR FOR WRITS OF PROHIBITION AND MANDAMUS DIRECTED AGAINST THE MEMBERS OF THE THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT TO COMPEL THEM TO DECIDE THE MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND THE MOTION TO DISMISS, OR TO REFRAIN FROM PROCEEDING FURTHER IN THE CAUSE AND TO VACATE THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER.  THIS COURT ISSUED AN ORDER TO THE MEMBERS OF THE DISTRICT COURT TO SHOW CAUSE WHY A WRIT OF MANDAMUS OR PROHIBITION SHOULD NOT ISSUE.  THE DISTRICT COURT, ON MOTION OF ONE OF THE COMPLAINANTS IN THE PROCEEDING BEFORE IT, THEN VACATED ITS TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT.

    HELD:  IT APPEARING THAT THE CAUSE HAS BECOME MOOT, THE RULE TO SHOW CAUSE IS DISCHARGED AND THE MOTION IS DENIED.

    JULY 3, 1957 - THE GOVERNOR AND ATTORNEY GENERAL FILED IN THIS COURT A MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS OR FOR WRITS OF PROHIBITION AND MANDAMUS DIRECTED AGAINST THE MEMBERS OF THE THREE JUDGE DISTRICT COURT TO COMPEL THEM TO DECIDE THE MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND THE MOTION TO DISMISS, OR TO REFRAIN FROM PROCEEDING FURTHER IN THE CAUSE AND TO VACATE THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER.

    PETITIONERS ASSERTED, AMONG OTHER GROUNDS FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THE WRITS, THAT IN A CASE OF GREAT PUBLIC IMPORTANCE THE DISTRICT COURT HAD, FOR AN UNREASONABLE TIME, FAILED TO PERFORM ITS JUDICIAL FUNCTION BY GRANTING OR DENYING THE MOTIONS BEFORE IT, WHILE CONTINUING IN EFFECT THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER.

    OCT. 28, 1957 - THIS COURT ISSUED AN ORDER TO THE MEMBERS OF THE DISTRICT COURT TO SHOW CAUSE ON OR BEFORE NOVEMBER 12TH WHY A WRIT OF MANDAMUS OR PROHIBITION SHOULD NOT ISSUE.  THIS ORDER WAS SENT TO THE RESPONDENTS THE SAME DAY, MONDAY, OCTOBER 28TH.

    OCT. 29, 1957 - THE NEXT DAY, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED AN ORDER, ON THE MOTION OF VOISINE AND WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE OTHER COMPLAINANTS, VACATING THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, WE ARE ADVISED, WAS NOT GIVEN NOTICE THAT THE DISTRICT COURT WOULD ACT ON THE MOTION TO DISMISS, OR GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OBJECTIONS.

    OCT. 31, 1957 - DEFENDANTS FILED WITH THE DISTRICT COURT AN ANSWER TO THE MOTION TO DISMISS, ASSERTING THAT THE COURT SHOULD REFRAIN FROM ACTING ON THE MOTION UNTIL IT HAD FILED A RETURN TO THIS COURT'S ORDER OF OCTOBER 28TH TO SHOW CAUSE.

    NOV. 4, 1957 - THE DISTRICT COURT ADVISED THIS COURT OF THE ORDER OF DISMISSAL OF OCTOBER 29TH, AND EXPRESSED ITS VIEW THAT, SINCE THE ISSUES PRESENTED BY THE CASE ARE MOOT, THIS COURT SHOULD VACATE ITS ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE.

    NOV. 8, 1957 - THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MICHIGAN, PROTESTING AGAINST THE DISTRICT COURT'S ACTION, REQUESTED A DETERMINATION OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED IN SPITE OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S ORDER DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT.

    FROM THE FOREGOING IT APPEARS THAT AS A RESULT OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S REFUSAL TO PASS ON THE QUESTIONS PRESENTED BY THE COMPLAINANTS' MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND THE DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS, TOGETHER WITH THE COURT'S CONTINUANCE OF THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER, THE GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN AND SUBORDINATE STATE OFFICIALS DESIGNATED BY HIM WERE PREVENTED FOR ALMOST NINE MONTHS FROM EXERCISING POWERS CLAIMED TO BE CONFERRED UPON THEM BY MICHIGAN LAW TO REMOVE MUNICIPAL OFFICERS GUILTY OF MISCONDUCT.  THE MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE A PETITION FOR MANDAMUS OR PROHIBITION WAS FILED IN THIS COURT AT THE END OF THE 1956 TERM AND COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED UNTIL THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE NEW TERM.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COURT CONSIDERED THE MOTION AND ISSUED ITS ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE ON THE BASIS OF A CLAIM THAT CHALLENGED THE VALIDITY OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE DISTRICT COURT, THAT COURT DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT AND THEREBY DERAILED, AS IN EFFECT IT HAS ASSERTED, CONSIDERATION ON THE MERITS OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED BY THE ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE.  PUTTING TO ONE SIDE THE VALIDITY OR PROPRIETY OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S ACTION IN RELATION TO THE ORDER OF OCTOBER 28TH, AND ACCEPTING THE DISMISSAL AS ACCOMPLISHED, WE MUST DENY THE PETITION FOR MANDAMUS OR PROHIBITION.  BY VACATING THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT, THE DISTRICT COURT HAS BROUGHT TO PASS ONE ALTERNATIVE OF THE ORDER PETITIONERS WOULD HAVE THIS COURT ISSUE, THUS RENDERING THE PETITION FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES MOOT.  BUT, ALTHOUGH THE PAST CANNOT BE RECALLED AND THE PHYSICAL ENTRIES IN THE RECORDS EXPUNGED, THE LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPLICATIONS OF THIS CASE ARE TO BE DEEMED EXPUNGED AS THOUGH THE RESTRAINTS IMPOSED BY THE DISTRICT COURT HAD NEVER BEEN ORDERED.

    FN1  SECTION 767.3 AUTHORIZES A SINGLE JUDGE TO CONDUCT AN INQUIRY INTO ALLEGED ILLEGAL PRACTICES.   SECTION 767.4 PROVIDES THAT IF THE JUDGE IS SATISFIED THAT AN OFFENSE HAS BEEN COMMITTED AND THAT THERE IS PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE A PERSON GUILTY THEREOF, HE MAY CAUSE HIS APPREHENSION ON PROPER PROCESS.  IT FURTHER PROVIDES THAT IF THE JUDGE HAS PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT ANY PUBLIC OFFICER REMOVABLE BY LAW HAS BEEN GUILTY OF MISFEASANCE OR MALFEASANCE IN OFFICE, HE SHALL MAKE FINDINGS TO THIS EFFECT AND SERVE THEM UPON THE PUBLIC OFFICIAL HAVING JURISDICTION TO REMOVE THE ACCUSED OFFICER.

    FN2  SECTION 767.4 PROVIDES THAT FINDINGS OF PROBABLE CAUSE TRANSMITTED TO THE GOVERNOR BY A JUDGE WHO HAS CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION UNDER SEC. 767.3 SHALL BE A SUFFICIENT COMPLAINT AS A BASIS FOR INITIATION OF REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS.  SECTION 168.327 AUTHORIZES THE GOVERNOR TO REMOVE AN ELECTED MUNICIPAL OFFICER WHEN SATISFIED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE SUBMITTED TO HIM IN THE MANNER PRESCRIBED BY LAW THAT THE OFFICER IS GUILTY OF MISCONDUCT.  SECTIONS 201.7 AND 201.10 AUTHORIZE THE GOVERNOR TO DIRECT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO INQUIRE INTO THE CHARGES AND TO PRESENT TESTIMONY AND EXAMINE WITNESSES BEFORE A PROBATE JUDGE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR SUCH PURPOSE.  THE PROBATE JUDGE IS TO CERTIFY A TRANSCRIPT OF THE TESTIMONY PRODUCED BEFORE HIM BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE ACCUSED OFFICER, AND DELIVER IT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR TRANSMITTAL TO THE GOVERNOR.    MEMORANDUM BY MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.    THIS COURT IS EMPOWERED BY THE CONSTITUTION TO DECIDE CASES AND CONTROVERSIES.  U.S. CONST., ART. III, SEC. 2.  A CAUSE THAT HAS BECOME MOOT IS NOT A CASE OR CONTROVERSY IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE.   AMALGAMATED ASSN. OF STREET, ELECTRIC RY. & MOTOR COACH EMPLOYEES V. WISCONSIN BOARD, [340 U.S. 416][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/340/416], 418.  WE CANNOT UNDERSCORE THIS PRINCIPLE TOO HEAVILY.  WE HAVE NO BUSINESS IN GIVING ANY EXPRESSION OF VIEWS ON THE MERITS, EVEN IN SQUINTING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.  THAT IS WHY THE COURT PROPERLY RESTRICTS ITS ACTION TO THE ORDER ENTERED THIS DAY.
