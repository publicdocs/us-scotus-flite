BOARD OF EDUCATION, [347 U.S. 483][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/347/483].  AS THIS CASE INVOLVES THE ADMISSION OF A NEGRO TO A GRADUATE PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL, THERE IS NO REASON FOR DELAY.  HE IS ENTITLED TO PROMPT ADMISSION UNDER THE RULES AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OTHER QUALIFIED CANDIDATES.  SWEATT V. PAINTER, [339 U.S. 629][/us/courts/scotus/usReporter/339/629]; SIPUEL V.
